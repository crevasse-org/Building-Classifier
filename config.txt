Run this command to install necessary packages with pip (change first part of file path to work on your machine):
pip install -r C:\Users\lukes\Desktop\Building-Classifier\requirements.txt

Verify that this snippet is one of the arguments in the predict function in the text_sam.py file (part of segment-geospatial package):
return_coords = False,

Verify that this snippet is at the end of the predict function in the text_sam.py file (part of segment-geospatial package):
if return_coords:
            boxlist = []
            for box in self.boxes:
                box = box.cpu().numpy()
                boxlist.append((box[0], box[1]))
            return boxlist

It might be necessary to manually add this snippet if the authors of segment-geospatial have not updated the pypi package.
Finally, because I am too lazy to create a file where you store your parameters, you can manually change the classification.py file based on your needs.
